# Service Configuration

The Cloud Provider Ranker comes with two simple normalization files
which are put in a path known by the start script
`/etc/init.d/cloudproviderranker`:

* `/usr/share/java/cpr/sla_priorities.json`
* `/usr/share/java/cpr/paasmetric_normalization.json`

The admin doesn't have to take care about them if she/he is happy with
the basic normalization values (see the
section [Ranking Algorithm](chapter08.md) for details).
